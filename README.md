# Portfolio

<p>
Hi, I'm Pablo and this is my personal portfolio web page using Django.
</p>
<p> 
Feel free to browse through the code. This is my very first Django project so the 
code may not look like what is expected from a full-stack developer
project but hey, not bad for a first time right? 
</p>
<p>
I know what it's like wanting to start to code and not knowing how or where, so if you
ever have a doubt of the code or want to know how was I able to code this in a week 
without having ever done a Django project before just send me a message!
</p>
<p>
When the web page is finished I'll upload the link so you can browse on it.
</p>
;)
